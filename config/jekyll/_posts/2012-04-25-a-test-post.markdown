Clearance sales point to a perennial problem in the fashion industry: the misalignment of supply and demand. Using traditional market research, brands and retailers are unable to predict with high accuracy what products consumers will actually purchase during any given season. As a result, merchandise that doesn’t sell is marked down, while demand for popular items goes unmet, leading to significant loss of income.

But better aligning supply and demand is a complex matter. That’s because, in trend-driven product categories like fashion, historical sales data never results in consistently better commercial decisions. What brands and retailers really require is information about what’s going to happen, not what’s already happened. But traditional fashion forecasting tools like panel-based research and trend reports are slow and unscientific, leaving buyers and merchants to make important business decisions based largely on intuition.
